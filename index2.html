    <p>Here is a block quotation of Walmart's Commitment:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.walmartcanada.ca/our-story/our-commitment">
      Fifty years ago, Sam Walton established Walmart as a place for people to shop for quality goods at discounted prices. Since then, Walmart has grown around the world but that commitment has never wavered. In Canada, Walmart's mission is clear - we want to save Canadians money to help them live better. We believe Canadians deserve access to the quality products they need, at everyday low prices, in the ways they want to shop for them. That's our commitment to you.
